September of 2022 from a preliminary estimate of 49.2, but still pointing to the third consecutive month of falling services sector activity. The fall in output was only marginal overall, as firms noted that improved demand conditions led to a weaker decline. New orders returned to growth, with domestic sales supporting the upturn, as new export business fell further. The rate of job creation softened to the slowest in 2022 to date, however, as challenges finding and retaining staff persisted. Labor and input shortages sparked a renewed rise in backlogs of work. Meanwhile, cost pressures eased for the fourth month running amid reports of some reductions in input prices. Hopes of greater client demand, a peaking of inflation and investment in new products drove business expectations for the year-ahead to the highest for four months.\",\n          \"US Manufacturing PMI Revised Slightly Up: MarkitUnited States Manufacturing PMIThe IHS Markit US Manufacturing PMI was revised marginally higher to 53.9 in November of 2017 from a preliminary reading of 53.8 but remained below 54.6 in October. Output, new orders, employment all rose at a softer pace while signs of capacity pressures persisted, with backlogs of work increasing again. In addition, cost pressures intensified with output inflation reaching the highest since December of 2013.

September of 2022 from a preliminary estimate of 49.2, but still pointing to the third consecutive month of falling services sector activity. The fall in output was only marginal overall, as firms noted that improved demand conditions led to a weaker decline. New orders returned to growth, with domestic sales supporting the upturn, as new export business fell further. The rate of job creation softened to the slowest in 2022 to date, however, as challenges finding and retaining staff persisted. Labor and input shortages sparked a renewed rise in backlogs of work. Meanwhile, cost pressures eased for the fourth month running amid reports of some reductions in input prices. Hopes of greater client demand, a peaking of inflation and investment in new products drove business expectations for the year-ahead to the highest for four months.\",\n          \"US Manufacturing PMI Revised Slightly Up: MarkitUnited States Manufacturing PMIThe IHS Markit US Manufacturing PMI was revised marginally higher to 53.9 in November of 2017 from a preliminary reading of 53.8 but remained below 54.6 in October. Output, new orders, employment all rose at a softer pace while signs of capacity pressures persisted, with backlogs of work increasing again. In addition, cost pressures intensified with output inflation reaching the highest since December of 2013.

Less than Expected: S\u0026P GlobalUnited States Services PMIThe S\u0026P Global US Services PMI was revised slightly higher to 49.3 in September of 2022 from a preliminary estimate of 49.2, but still pointing to the third consecutive month of falling services sector activity. The fall in output was only marginal overall, as firms noted that improved demand conditions led to a weaker decline. New orders returned to growth, with domestic sales supporting the upturn, as new export business fell further. The rate of job creation softened to the slowest in 2022 to date, however, as challenges finding and retaining staff persisted. Labor and input shortages sparked a renewed rise in backlogs of work. Meanwhile, cost pressures eased for the fourth month running amid reports of some reductions in input prices. Hopes of greater client demand, a peaking of inflation and investment in new products drove business expectations for the year-ahead to the highest for four months.\",\n          \"US Manufacturing PMI Revised Slightly Up: MarkitUnited States Manufacturing PMIThe IHS Markit US Manufacturing PMI was revised marginally higher to 53.9 in November of 2017 from a preliminary reading of 53.8 but remained below 54.6 in October. Output, new orders, employment all rose at a softer pace while signs of capacity pressures persisted, with backlogs of work increasing again. In addition, cost pressures intensified with output inflation reaching the highest since December of 2013. On the other hand, business confidence was the strongest since January of 2016.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Daily_Return\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.3868604279292376,\n        \"min\": -11.984419148512371,\n        \"max\": 10.705610348561567,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2799,\n        \"samples\": [\n          -0.1430628368899067,\n          -0.3422997110331005\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}","type":"dataframe","variable_name":"merged_data"},"text/html":["\n","  \u003cdiv id=\"df-fe113c3c-401f-455f-a30e-d8e57c319ea8\" class=\"colab-df-container\"\u003e\n","    \u003cdiv\u003e\n","\u003cstyle scoped\u003e\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","\u003c/style\u003e\n","\u003ctable border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\"\u003e\n","  \u003cthead\u003e\n","    \u003ctr style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003e\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003eDate\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003eOpen\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003eMovement\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003esentiment_volatility_lag1\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003eaggregate_sentiment_score_lag1\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003eClose_lag1\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003eHigh_lag1\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003eVolume_lag1\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003eDaily_Return_lag1\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003eVolatility_lag1\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003eTitle\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003ecleaned_content\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003eDaily_Return\u003c/th\u003e\n","    \u003c/tr\u003e\n","  \u003c/thead\u003e\n","  \u003ctbody\u003e\n","    \u003ctr\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003e0\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e2007-08-01\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e1455.18\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e0\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e0.268142\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e0.00\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e1455.27\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e1488.30\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e4.524520e+09\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e-0.251552\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e0.991957\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003eU.S. Companies added the smallest number of jo...\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003eU.S. Companies added the smallest number of jo...\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e0.724264\u003c/td\u003e\n","    \u003c/tr\u003e\n","    \u003ctr\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003e1\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e2007-08-07\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e1467.61\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e1\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e0.270222\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e-0.15\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e1465.81\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e1468.38\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e5.256780e+09\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e0.724264\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e1.257202\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003eUS Federal Reserve keeps interest rates unchan...\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003eUS Federal Reserve keeps interest rates unchan...\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e0.742934\u003c/td\u003e\n","    \u003c/tr\u003e\n","    \u003ctr\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003e2\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e2007-08-10\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e1453.08\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e0\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e0.262336\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e0.00\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e1476.70\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e1488.30\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e4.909390e+09\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e0.742934\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e1.384401\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003eStock Markets Fall Worldwide!
